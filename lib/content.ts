**Project Overview**

In this project, our team set out to build a Learning Management System (LMS) from the ground up. The goal was to create a platform capable of handling a growing number of users (students, trainers, and admins), while offering interactive learning experiences, content control mechanisms, and a robust backend infrastructure.

I was onboarded as a Backend Developer, responsible for designing and implementing a scalable, efficient, and maintainable backend system using the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and **Kafka** for asynchronous event handling.

---

**Problem Statement**

- Designing an architecture that could scale with user growth and high traffic surges.
- Managing different user roles (students, trainers, admins) with dynamic access and content workflows.
- Implementing real-time interactions and personalized learning features.
- Ensuring clean, maintainable code with complete API documentation for collaboration and future scaling.

---

**My Contribution**

- Designed and built key backend modules
- Set up database schemas and relationships
- Integrated event-driven features using Kafka
- Provided robust API documentation
- Collaborated cross-functionally with front-end and DevOps teams

---

**Key Backend Features & Technical Contributions**

üèóÔ∏è **Modular Architecture Design**

- Used Node.js and Express, structured with SOLID principles.
- Logical service segregation:
  - Course/content delivery
  - Enrollment tracking
  - Trainer-student workflows
  - Admin dashboard & analytics

üë• **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- JWT-based secure auth
- Middleware for dynamic access control

üìö **Admin-Driven Content Management**

- Create, update, publish courses
- Moderate interactions
- View analytics

üí¨ **Interactive Learning Features**

- Comment threads, likes, trainer replies
- Lazy loading & pagination

‚öôÔ∏è **Asynchronous Event Handling with Kafka**

- Notifications, user activity logging
- Non-blocking operations

üìÑ **API Documentation**

- Documented with Swagger
- Boosted frontend collaboration

---

**Development Practices**

- Agile, CI/CD with Docker
- Testing with Jest

---

**Impact & Results**

üöÄ Scalable to 100s of users  
üîê Secure and reliable  
üí¨ Higher engagement  
üß© Modular, dev-friendly code  
üìä Admins empowered with insights

---

**Key Takeaways**

- Scalable architecture starts with the right mindset.
- Kafka simplified background tasks and improved UX.
- Good documentation and modularity help teams move faster.

Have you ever wondered how JavaScript handles your code under the hood? The answer lies in the **Global Execution Context (GEC)** ‚Äî the foundation where everything begins.

---

### What is the Global Execution Context?

When JavaScript runs, it creates an execution context to manage the code. The GEC is the first context that is created when:

- A JavaScript file is loaded in the browser.
- Code is executed in a Node.js environment.

It consists of two critical phases:

1. **Memory Creation Phase**
2. **Code Execution Phase**

---

### Phase 1: Memory Creation Phase

- \`var\` variables ‚Üí memory allocated & initialized as \`undefined\`
- \`function\` declarations ‚Üí stored in memory with full definitions
- \`let\` and \`const\` ‚Üí memory allocated but not initialized (TDZ)

---

### Phase 2: Code Execution Phase

- Code is executed line by line.
- \`var\` variables get assigned actual values.
- \`let\`/\`const\` trigger ReferenceError if accessed before init.
- Functions declared using the \`function\` keyword can be invoked early.

---

### Example:

\`\`\`js
var a = 10;
function greet() {
  console.log("hello there");
}
const sayHi = () => {
  console.log("hi there");
};
\`\`\`

#### Behind the Scenes (GEC):

**Memory Creation:**

- a ‚Üí \`undefined\`
- greet ‚Üí full function definition
- sayHi ‚Üí TDZ

**Code Execution:**

- a = 10
- greet() ‚úÖ
- sayHi() ‚ùå ReferenceError if called early

---

### üí° Key Takeaways

- \`var\` is hoisted and initialized as \`undefined\`.
- \`let\`/\`const\` are hoisted but uninitialized ‚Üí TDZ.
- Function declarations are fully hoisted.
- Arrow functions assigned to \`const\`/let are not callable before definition.

---

### Wrapping Up

Understanding the Global Execution Context helps avoid bugs and write smarter JS. Stay tuned for more JS internals! üöÄ
